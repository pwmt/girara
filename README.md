girara - user interface library
===============================

girara is a library that implements a user interface that focuses on simplicity
and minimalism. It consists of three main components: The view is a widget that
represents the actual application (e.g.: a web site or a document). The input

notifies the user with current information. It is designed to replace and the
enhance the user interface that is used by zathura.
